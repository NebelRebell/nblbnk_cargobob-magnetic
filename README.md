# FiveM Mechanic Magnet Script
# nblbnk_cargobob-magnetic

## Overview

This script is designed for FiveM servers and adds functionality for mechanics to use a magnet with cargo helicopters. The script allows mechanics to activate and deactivate a magnet, adjust its strength, and attach or detach vehicles. The script uses native FiveM functions and is intended to enhance the roleplay experience for mechanics.

## Features

- Activate/Deactivate magnet on cargo helicopters
- Adjust magnet strength
- Attach/Detach vehicles
- Job-specific: Only mechanics can use this feature
- **Important**: Once the magnet is deactivated, it cannot be reactivated without respawning the Cargobob.

## Installation

1. Download the script and place it in your server's resource folder.
2. Add `start [YourScriptFolderName]` to your `server.cfg` file.
3. Restart your server or type `refresh` in the server console, followed by `start [YourScriptFolderName]`.

## Usage

- Press `H` to toggle the magnet on/off.
- Press `Left Ctrl + E` to toggle magnet power.
